## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a collection of R models and code examples for data scientists, statisticians, and anyone interested in learning more about data analysis with R. The scripts included here cover a variety of topics and methodologies, serving as a resource for both beginners and experienced users.

## Installation

To run the R scripts in this repository, you'll need to have R installed on your machine. You can download R from the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).

Additionally, you may need to install the required packages. You can do this by running the following command in your R console:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret", "randomForest", "tidyverse"))
```
If you're using **Postit Cloud**, ensure you have set up your environment correctly to run R scripts from the cloud.

## Usage
To use the scripts in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KalmathAjay/R-Models.git
```
Then, navigate to the project directory and open any of the R scripts in your preferred R IDE (such as RStudio) to explore the code and run the models.

## Models

This repository includes the following models:

1. **Linear Regression** - A basic example of linear regression for predicting a continuous variable.
2. **Logistic Regression** - A model for binary classification tasks.
3. **Decision Trees** - An implementation of decision trees for classification and regression.
4. **Random Forests** - A robust model that builds multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
5. **K-Means Clustering** - An unsupervised learning example for clustering data points.
